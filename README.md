# PaddleGame

A simple paddle game made on Unreal Engine 4 following the [Free3dee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAiON05sNv8&list=PL4AluGdTlI1oetBscgzEmVqM9icCEvWon) tutorial.

The concept is very simple: a ball is spawned randomly against one of two players, you or the IA must bounce the ball with the paddle in order to make a "goal"; after the first try, the ball will ever be shot against the player which received the "goal" .

This repository has two versions: [C++](https://github.com/SalahAdDin/PaddleGame/tree/c++) and [Blueprint](https://github.com/SalahAdDin/PaddleGame/tree/blueprints).

Feel free to make pull request and issues.



## TODO:

- [ ] Create a `PaddleCharacter` based on `PaperCharacter` with **C++**.
- [ ] Create an `AIController` for the AI Player with **C++**.
- [ ] Replace the **Blueprints** by above **C++** based **Blueprints.**
